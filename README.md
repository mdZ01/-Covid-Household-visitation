## COVID Household Visitation

This is a code and data repository for the paper [Household visitation during the COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-02092-7) by Stuart Ross, 
George Breckenridge, Mengdie Zhuang, and Ed Manley.

Household visits have been linked to broadening community transmission of the COVID-19, and many public health policy 
responses focused directly on reducing these activities. 
We propose a novel, privacy-preserving framework for the measurement of household 
visitation at national and regional scales, making use of passively collected mobility data from Cuebiq through their [Data for Good programme](https://www.cuebiq.com/about/data-for-good/). 
The findings point to complex social processes unfolding differently over space and time, 
likely informed by variations in policy adherence, vaccine relaxation, and local interventions.

The `household_visit_england.csv` contains the household visitation rates in England from January 2020 to May 2021 for each LTLA. 

The Jupyter notebook `Household Visitation.ipynb` contains the code segements used to generate estimates of household visitation rate from mobility data.
Note that the raw mobility data is not publicly accessible.
